	Baby sitter, pay calculator

Baby Sitter: Uses calculator to find hours between start, bed, and end time. Uses calculator to find total 
dollar amount owed based on hours worked.

Pay Calculator: calculate number of hours from start to bed time given those times. Calculate number of hours
from bed time to midnight given bed time. Calculate number of hours from midnight to end time given end time.
Calculate total due for pre-bedtime work. Calculate total due for bed time to midnight work. Calculate total due
for post-midnight work. Calculate grand total due for whole nights work.

preconditions:
1. Start time at or later than 5:00 pm.
2. End time is at or before 4:00 am.

instance variables:
1. Start-bed time rate: $12/hr
2. Bed-midnight rate: $8/hr
3. Midnight-end time rate: $16/hr
*These could change in the future

be sure to test for:
1. Start time is after bed time.
2. Start time is after midnight.
3. Bed time is after midnight.
4. fractional hours
...

How to deal with fractional hours?

-we can round to nearest whole hour, smallest whole hour, or largest whole hour.
--rounding to smallest whole hour would fit with the problem description the most however the babysitter could
end up working 2 hours 57 mins unpaid. 
--Rounding up could lead to getting paid 2hours and 57 minutes not worked.
--Rounding to nearest whole hour could lead to getting paid for a 1.5 hours not worked or working for 1 hour 
29 mins unpaid.
